// app.js does not create element ids. Grepping its template literals for `id="` and its
// code for `.id =` returns nothing: every id it touches is declared in index.html and
// nowhere else. That makes "every id app.js looks up exists in index.html" an exact,
// checkable property rather than a heuristic — and one worth checking, because both ways
// of getting it wrong are silent.
//
// document.getElementById returns null for an id that is not there, and app.js is written
// defensively throughout — `if (!el) return`, `el?.addEventListener`, and a setTxt helper
// that no-ops when the element is missing. So a renamed or deleted id does not throw and
// does not log: the button simply stops doing anything, or the tile keeps its placeholder
// dash forever. That is how a whole 37-line API-key regeneration handler sat in this file
// bound to `regen-api-key-btn` while index.html only ever declared
// `regenerate-api-key-btn` — dead code that looked live, found by hand-diffing the two
// lists, which is what this file replaces.
